# E06b-Tiles
Playing with the Tiled Map Editor

My addition to this assignment was building the map, reducing the character size, increasing its speed and increasing the tile sizing for optimal play. The goal was simply to practice with a 2D platformer. 

To earn extra credit,

 * Create main2.py
 * Copy into main2.py the code found here: [http://arcade.academy/examples/09_endgame.html#endgame](http://arcade.academy/examples/09_endgame.html#endgame).
 * in main2.py, delete the references to sounds (lines 72–75, 184, 213–214, 230, 244)
 * Create three new maps, called map2_level_1.tmx, map2_level_2.tmx, and map2_level_3.tmx
 * In each of those three maps, you will the following layers: Platforms, Coins, Foreground, Background, Don't Touch
 * Find, create, or download assets to fill out this three-level platformer. 
 * Make changes until you have a working three-level game

As always, update the LICENSE, this file (README.md) and submit the URL to your repository on Canvas.
